## magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

This is different from MPRAGE images. MP2RAGE generates three sets of images, which are two sets of images at two different TI with one TI specified with nulled gray matter signal and one set of images as the ratio between the two. The ratio images have much better gray/white matter contrast. It is that set of images (ratio images) to be used for FreeSurfer reconstruction.

The images below are three sets of images from one subject at 7T using MP2RAGE. The one in the middle should be used for FreeSurfer reconstruction.

## electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG)

Run the following commands to get 9 intermediate equi-spaced surfaces between gray/white matter boundary (?h.white) and gray matter/pial surface boundary (?h.pial).

## stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG)

## transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
