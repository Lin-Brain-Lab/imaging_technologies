We focus on the methodological devlopment of human neuroimaging and neuromodulation methods to study neuroscientific questions and translate these technologies to improve health care.

## magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

MRI uses a strong magnetic field to delineate brain structure, function, and metabolism. We continuously develop imaging acquisition and analysis for brain imaging.

## electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG)

EEG and MEG non-invasively measuers the post-synaptic neural activity. We seek technological advancement of EEG and MEG and synergic combination of these methods with MRI.

## stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG)

SEEG provides an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution of neuronal activities. These invasive measurements are done in epilepsy patients. SEEG can not only benefit epilepsy management but also advance our understanding of neuronal activity during cognition and behaviours. 

## transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)

TMS non-invasively activates the neural activity via a transiently strong magnetic field. It is a powerful interventional device for modulating neuoronal dynamics and managing mental disorders. Coupling TMS with neuroimaging methods has the promise of sensitive and spatiotemporally accurate modulation of the neuronal activity.
